                                    <p>
                                        As a quick introduction to some of the important points on learning copywriting, the first key is to pay attention to the headline. The headline is read more often than copy at an exponential rate. If you cannot catch someone’s attention with the headline, you have wasted the rest of your sales copy. A sales letter essentially only has about five seconds in which you can grab a person’s attention and the headline is one the most important factors in being able to pull that attention. This is just an example of copywriting and what you must look for.

                                    </p>

                                    

                                    <p>
                                        
                                        This is the key when you are learning copywriting. You must learn to communicate with the audience in a way that persuades them to buy the product or service that you are writing about. There must be an initial connection that is made or else you’ll find that you’ve lost the audience’s attention. In this day and age, people are inundated with the number of advertisements that they see every day and quickly discard any advertisement that does not fit within their perspective immediately. You must realize that your writing cannot be for the entertainment of an audience now but rather to sell a product or service.
                                    </p>

                                        If you are a good writer, you should be able to pick up copywriting. The key behind copywriting is that you must understand that you’re writing in a different style and to a different audience. A good quote that will be used to start this article comes from the book The Copywriter’s Handbook, A Step-By-Step Guide to Writing Copy that Sells. “A copywriter is a sales person behind a typewriter.” (p.1 of book mentioned above) businesses offer.
                                    </p>

                                        

                                        <p>In learning copywriting, look into the works of Dan Kennedy. He is one of the foremost experts on the subject and he has said before that he became better by continual development of his skills. If you would like to learn more about any one of his books, look into the following title: The Ultimate Sales Letter. You will want to make yourself a lifelong student of the subject in learning copywriting because there is always something more to know.
                                                Hopefully this article on learning copywriting has helped you. This field will seem very challenging but at the same point it is one of the more interesting fields that you can find out there. The key to being successful and copywriting is to learn from what you do. If you constantly read and continue to develop your skills, you’ll find that you will become a great copywriter. It is hard within a single page to truly give you an idea of what it takes to be a copywriter but go back to the quote at the beginning of the article that a copywriter is a person who sells. Your goal is to educate an audience in a way that persuades them. This is the only difference between how you currently write and how you will write as a copywriter.

                                                but because i love you i'll give you some writing tips
                                        </p>

                                        

                                        <p>
                                                Improving these two skills will allow you to have a meteoric rise in the income that you bring in. Many copywriters are very strong in their profession but are not very good at procuring clients. If you are able to sell yourself to potential clients, you’ll never find yourself short of work. The ability to sell yourself is what will set you apart from all the other freelance copywriters out there. You must make sure that you have a portfolio of your best work. Within this portfolio, 
                                                <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/osmben/create-personal-portfolio-website-or-landing-page-business-website">CLICK HERE</a> to create your own professional portfolio website-
                                                you’ll want to have a letter explaining your qualifications along with samples of your writing as well as testimonials from your previous jobs. If you are able to e-mail this to your potential clients, this will help set you apart. They can see the professional work you have done in the past as well as the client base that you currently work with. If you are able to reference Fortune 500 companies you have worked with, this will continue to improve your credibility. If you are just starting out in the copywriting field, delete the potential references and replace this with more work that you have done in the past. If you have worked for an advertising agency and are beginning to freelance, make sure to include some the work that you have done at the advertising agency.
                                        </p>

                                       

                                        <p>Two possible ways that you can acquire clients are to post at different contracting websites such as elance.com or directfreelance.com. You can also research companies who you can potentially see if they need work. If you spend time reading the business section every day, cut out articles that might be within your particular field and keep them in a centralized location. This could be a potential source of leads for you depending upon how the companies are doing and if it is in a predicament where your skills may be needed
