                                            <p>After you have found a profitable trading system that you already back-tested, how can you be sure that this system will produce the same gains in future?

                                                Nobody can predict the future, your system can easily make losses in next years or can be no tradable.
                                                
                                                There are some tests you must do before accepting a trading system, these tests swill show the robustness of your system and when passing these tests, it will be more likely to show gain in future.
                                            </br></br>
                                        
                                                Test 1 : Make sure that you put liquidity rule, that your entry and exit prices are realizable.
                                            </br></br>
                                                Test 2: Examine again your trading systems and your rules (This is very important).
                                            </br></br>
                                                I made dozen of trading systems that showed great results but after more examination, it showed that i cannot follow them in real life.
                                                
                                                Check if there is one stock that made very big gain, the system will maybe become no profitable without this stock.
                                                 </br></br>
                                                Test 3: Change twice or 3 times the date of begin for the simulation, if it still show good results then it has passed the test 3.
                                            </br></br>
                                                Test 4: Change values of some parameters or variables you have in your trading system rules, you must change one value and then back-test, change another and then back-test…
                                                
                                                If the results are not affected very badly then it passed the test 4.
                                            </br></br>
                                                Test 5: Try to restrict the system from buying 20% or more of stocks you previously bought when doing the back-test. Then re-run the back-test. To pass this test, system must show pretty the same results as before.
                                            </br></br>
                                                Test 6: Equity chart must have a good look, check some statistic values like sharpe ratio, sortino ratio, standard deviation, maximum drawdown, average day for gains recovery…
                                                
                                                It depends on the risk you are willing to take but choose only systems that have : higher sharpe ratio, higher sortino ratio, lower standard deviation, lower maximum drawdown…
                                                
                                                Exclude systems that have very big max drawdown, standard deviation and average day for gains recovery.
                                                
                                                The must important factor i think is average day for gains recovery.
                                                
                                                Its the average number of day that you must wait until your equity value will goes back to the same level before the drawdown happen.
                                                
                                                Big values will let you wait for long times before recovering gains and for sure many traders will abandon their trading system, and that’s the worse thing that can happen to a trader because just after that, the system will show excellent results. (That’s always happen)
                                                
                                                Theses tests are very restrictive and you will reject maybe all your trading systems, but when trading you will put your money, real money, so i think you must be very selective to make all chance in your side.

                                    <h3><strong>HOW TO PICK GOOD STOCKS PROFITBLE TRADING SYSTEM</strong></h3>
                                    <p>Stock picking is a very complicated process and investors have different approaches. However, it is wise to follow general steps to minimize the risk of the investments. This article will outline these basic steps for picking high performance stocks.
                                    </br></br>
                                        Step 1. Decide on the time frame and the general strategy of the investment. This step is very important because it will dictate the type of stocks you buy.
                                        
                                        Suppose you decide to be a long term investor, you would want to find stocks that have sustainable competitive advantages along with stable growth. The key for finding these stocks is by looking at the historical performance of each stock over the past decades and do a simple business S.W.O.T. (Strength-weakness-opportunity-threat) analysis on the company.
                                        
                                        If you decide to be a short term investor, you would like to adhere to one of the following strategies:
                                        
                                        a. Momentum Trading. This strategy is to look for stocks that increase in both price and volume over the recent past. Most technical analyses support this trading strategy. My advice on this strategy is to look for stocks that have demonstrated stable and smooth rises in their prices. The idea is that when the stocks are not volatile, you can simply ride the up-trend until the trend breaks.
                                        
                                        b. Contrarian Strategy. This strategy is to look for over-reactions in the stock market. Researches show that stock market is not always efficient, which means prices do not always accurately represent the values of the stocks. When a company announces a bad news, people panic and price often drops below the stock’s fair value. To decide whether a stock over-reacted to a news, you should look at the possibility of recovery from the impact of the bad news. For example, if the stock drops 20% after the company loses a legal case that has no permanent damage to the business’s brand and product, you can be confident that the market over-reacted. My advice on this strategy is to find a list of stocks that have recent drops in prices, analyze the potential for a reversal (through candlestick analysis). If the stocks demonstrate candlestick reversal patterns, I will go through the recent news to analyze the causes of the recent price drops to determine the existence of over-sold opportunities.
                                    </br></br>
                                        Step 2. Conduct researches that give you a selection of stocks that is consistent to your investment time frame and strategy. There are numerous stock screeners on the web that can help you find stocks according to your needs.
                                    </br></br>
                                        Step 3. Once you have a list of stocks to buy, you would need to diversify them in a way that gives the greatest reward/risk ratio. One way to do this is conduct a Markowitz analysis for your portfolio. The analysis will give you the proportions of money you should allocate to each stock. This step is crucial because diversification is one of the free-lunches in the investment world.
                                        
                                        These three steps should get you started in your quest to consistently make money in the stock market. They will deepen your knowledge about the financial markets, and would provide a sense of confidence that helps you to make better trading decisions.

                                  <h5>CHOSE A STOCKS BROKER</h5>
                                    <p>It is true that even though you can choose your own investments you must still use a stockbroker to execute the orders. You do not have to rely in their advice though it may be helpful. You can make your own selections but you will still require their services to invest. There was a time when you had no choice about the type of stockbroker to utilize. There was only one type of broker, the full service brokers, and they controlled the market. The commissions that they demanded for their services were very high but this was the industry standard. This contributed to the notion that the stock market and stock market investment were beyond the means of the average person and only for the very affluent.

                                        The initial loss of control of the market by these full service brokerages occurred in 1975 and discount brokers emerged. They charged a fraction of the fees the full service brokers did and as such were a big hit on the market. They offered the same great services but were affordable to the average individual as the cost were significantly lower. Another great innovation was the introduction of the internet. This was a great innovation as there was greater trading efficiency as a result.
                                        
                                        The overall effect of all the changes on the stock market was that individuals now had access to a ton of information that was never accessible to them previously. It is a debate however whether these avenues have in fact enhanced investments and made better investors. In the case of persons that do their homework and seek out the truth behind the hype the answer is a definitive yes. The investors out their can now choose the type of broker they require from the range available.
                                        
                                        There are four categories of brokers. These are the discount/online broker, the discount broker that provides advice, the full service broker and the money manager. The discount/online broker is basically an order taker. They do not offer advice and will not tell you when to buy or sell a stock. There may be research available and other account management tools but the choice of investment in the stock market is entirely up to you.
                                        
                                        The variation of the discount/online broker that assists customers is the nest type. They do not offer full consultation services but will have more research than order taking sites. They will offer newsletters and investing tips but most likely not recommend particular stocks. You are not totally on your own with this option but you will still need to do a lot in terms of deciding on the best stock investment.
                                        
                                        The full service broker will provide recommendations on specific stocks and the broker will also access your financial situation to determine your needs and investment options. This service is suitable for the investor that does not have the interest or time in making their investment decisions.
                                        
                                        The money manager is made for the investor with a hefty investment sum. This broker will handle only significant portfolios and will invest and manage the entire account for a percentage of the assets under investment. This option can be expensive but very worthwhile in the long run.
                                        
                                        Whichever option that you choose make sure it suits your purpose and that you are covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Ask about backups and other options in case of technical problems and ensure that your broker has your best interest at heart.</p>
                                        <h3><strong>How Do You Maximise Your Profits In Any Trade On The Stock Market</strong></h3>
                                    <p>In trading the stock market, no-one has a crystal ball. The price of stocks can go down, as well as up. What is needed is an exit strategy that will enable you to survive the bad stocks, and make a good profit on the good stocks.

                                        The method that I have found to work the best is a trailing stop loss. For those who don’t know what a stop loss is, I shall explain briefly. A stop loss is an order for your stock broker to sell your shares if the price dips to the level that you have specified.
                                        
                                        There are two ways of doing this. The simplest method is to decide on how much you are willing to lose as a percentage of your investment. A good rule is not to go less than 10%. Work out the price of the stock at this level and set that as your stop loss. As the price of the stock increases, keep moving the level of the stop up to keep the percentage gap the same. Some brokers offer a trailing stop loss service, where you tell them what percentage to set the loss at and they do it for you.
                                        
                                        The second method is slightly more complicated, and comes from “Nicolas Darvas” in his book “How I made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market”. The markets tend to flow in stages. a stock on the rise will reach a peak, and then dip back down. It may do this several times at each stage. The idea is to follow the chart of the stock and see where the dips are the lowest, and set the stop loss just below them. A second part which Nicolas propounds is that when the stock breaks out of the sideways trend, to buy more of the stock, and when the stock starts going sideways again to move the stop loss up again to just below the lowest part of the dip.
                                        
                                        Using the stop loss as an exit strategy, only works if you stick to it, and not lower it, thinking that the price will go up again in a few days. In a few cases you will be right, but what usually happens is the price keeps moving against you, and you loose even more money. As a secondary to this, the money still tied up in the first stock that is falling can’t be used on another trade.
                                        
                                        Finally, a word of warning about using the stop loss system to protect your capital. There are times when the markets undergoes a fast fall in price, there are regulations about how far a price can fall in one-day. If it falls this maximum distance, it can bypass your stop loss, and you may be unable to sell. Although these situations are rare, it is better that you know about them. So that they are not a shock when they do happen to you.</p>
