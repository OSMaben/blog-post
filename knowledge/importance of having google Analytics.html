                           <ul class="check">
                               <li><strong> Its free</strong> 
                               </br>
                                One of the biggest advantages of having a Google Analytics account is that it is free. This can help you save time and money. You can see the results and information in the dashboard.</li>
                               <li><strong> Automatic collection of data</strong>
                               </br>

                                Google Analytics automatically tracks user activity. Hence, you do not need to log in every day to record data. It also automatically collects data for mobile, desktop, and tablet devices.

                                Google Analytics allows you to create custom reports based on your needs. For example, if you want to know the number of sales from your e-commerce site, you can create a custom report.

                               </br>
                               Google Analytics is integrated with many tools and platforms. Google AdWords, Google Search Console, Google BigQuery, DoubleClick, Google Data Studio, Google Surveys, and Gmail are some of the platforms you can integrate with Google Analytics.

                               Most people who visit your website don’t make a purchase. In fact, up to 90% of them don't make a purchase. Google Analytics enables you to find out why they are leaving your website. If most of your visitors are leaving your website, Google Analytics will provide you with information on the reason why they are leaving. For example, if you are selling event or seminar tickets, Google Analytics will let you know if visitors are leaving the website because they cannot find the ticket price.</li>
