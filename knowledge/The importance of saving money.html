                                    <p>
                                            Your 5-year-old daughter has started asking for money to buy sweets and toys. She obviously has a good understanding of the concept of exchanging money for items she wants or needs, but what are the important lessons you should teach kids about money and saving. You want to make sure that she doesn’t grow up into one of those kids that are constantly pestering mom and dad for money, running up credit card debts as a teenager, and not having any idea how to save.

                                            There are 10 basic money skills that every child should learn before they enter the teenage years. It’s never too late to learn, but most children are far more receptive to ideas from their parents before they hit the age of thirteen, than after.
                                    </p>
                                <p>
                                   

                                <ul class="check">
                                        <li>
                                        1. Money doesn’t grow on trees! One of the best known and oldest quotes around. It is important that children understand from early on that money is a limited resource, that mom & dad’s bank account will eventually run dry if they keep making withdrawals from it
                                        </li>
                                        <li>2. People go to work to earn money. Money is something that needs to be earned, you are never going to become financially secure sitting around not doing anything, and expecting handouts from people.</li>
                                        <li>3. Credit cards are a form of borrowing. Believe it or not, surveys have shown that an alarmingly high number of teenagers don’t realise that credit cards are a form of borrowing. If they don’t understand this basic concept, it leaves them at risk of running up crippling credit card debts.</li>
                                        <li>4. Avoid borrowing money where possible. Wherever possible, money should be saved rather than borrowed as borrowing attracts extra costs such as interest, which can in some circumstances, double the amount of money you need to repay.</li>
                                        <li>
                                        5. There is good debt & bad debt. No debt is really all that good, but some forms of debt will make you money while others cost you money. Good debt can include a home loan, investment loan or business loan, as these items have a tendency to make money above the amount of interest you have to pay. Bad debt can include credit cards, personal loans or car loans, as these items never make you any money.</li>
                                        <li>6. If you don’t have the cash to buy something, then you can’t afford it.</li>
                                        <li>7. Spend less than you earn. Many people these days are spending 10% to 20% above what they earn, creating a vicious cycle of high credit card interest rates, long hours at work to pay the credit cards & in some cases bankruptcy. The knowledge of how to budget your money seems to have been lost, make sure your child learns this important lesson!
                                        </li>
                                        <li>    8. A portion of your money should be given to the needy. Around 10% of your money should be given to those who are in need/charities.</li>
                                        <li>  9. Pay yourself first. This is what I call your sanity money! Allow 10% of your money for yourself to spend however you wish.</li>
                                        <li> 10. Save at least 10% of your money. Like budgeting, the skill of saving money seems to have been lost over the last 20 years, with fewer people than ever before regularly saving a proportion of their income.</li>
                                    </ul> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 <h3>SHOULD I GIVE MY KIDS AN ALLOWNACE </h3>

                                </p>
                                <p>Sure, why not! Giving your child an allowance will assist in teaching your child responsibility, how to save and budget their money. It’s a good idea to consider starting an allowance for your child by the time they start first grade. By that time, your child will be able to learn more about money. They’ll need to start some time. The sooner the better! Here are some tips and suggestions on what you may want to consider when thinking about giving your child an allowance:

                                        1) How much allowance should I give my child? Well, make sure the amount you give your child is affordable to you and fits within your budget. Consider giving your child a certain amount of money per week based on their grade level or age. Make sure the amount of the allowance that you give your child each week is realistic for your budget. Be comfortable with the allowance you’re giving your child!
                                </br>
                                        2) Set-up chores for your child which are age appropriate and chores that your child will be able to handle with ease.
                                    </br>
                                        3) Consider giving your child a weekly allowance on the same day of the week. It this is not realistic for your budget, consider giving the allowance to your child every two weeks or on a monthly basis. Make sure the time frame that you give the allowance is around the same period of time on a weekly, monthly or bi-weekly basis.
                                    </br>
                                        4) You may want to consider giving your child a bonus amount on top of the allowance they receive for doing extra chores. Again, make sure that if you are considering doing this, that it fits within your budget.
                                    </br>
                                        5) Make sure the allowance you give to your child does not include their school lunch or supplies they need for school. These expenditures should be separate from your child’s allowance.
                                        </br>
                                        6) You may want to teach your child to save their allowance towards an item they want if it costs more than their allowance given on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis. This will allow your child the opportunity to learn how to save and budget for something they want to purchase.
                                    </br>
                                        7) As your child gets older, you may want to consider adjusting their allowance accordingly. Remember the older your child gets, the allowance is usually increased. Just make sure if the allowance is increased, you stay within your own budget!
                                    </br>
                                        Giving your child an allowance is important when you’re trying to teach your child about responsibility and budgeting for their personal finances. The earlier your child is able to learn how to manage their finances the better. By giving your child an allowance, this helps them as 
                                </br>
                                You say this is all good information, however, you’re unable to give your kids an allowance because you just don’t have enough money. What should I do, I really want my child to learn how to save? Don’t fret, they can still save! You can have them save by collecting bottles and cans to earn money so they can start saving. No matter, how much money your kids earn, every amount adds up!

                                So, it seems easy, It really is! Get your kids into the habit of saving today, so they will learn how to manage their finances now and for the future.

                                        AND WHY NOT 
                                       => Show your kid how much interest they can earn over time on their money when they save it! Especially the power of compound interest.
                                    </br>
                                    => By saving money today, your kids would have money saved, for a future purchase they might want to make.
                                    </br>
                                    => Make saving fun for your kid. Have your child put their savings in a piggy bank or jar so they can watch their money grow.
                                        </br>
                                    => Open a bank account for your kid and let them deposit money from their allowance or other monies received into their bank account.
                                </br>
                                <mark></mark> and that's how you can teach your Childs in the best way the importance of saving money .</mark>
