                                        Nowadays, we communicate more and more through email. We use Email communication to write something to friends, relatives, colleagues or clients. Whoever the recipient of your email, it is becoming very important that you write email effectively. As you know, by writing effective email, you can save your time, other person’s time and you can win more trust & confidence from the other end.
                                    </p>
                                     <h3><strong>Give Reply of Email As soon as Possible</strong></h3>
                                <p>
                                   
                                   
                                    More and more people contact each other through email. Even if they mention directly or not, they expect prompt responses. One of the study by Jupiter Research indicates that 35% of customers expect a reply within six hours, an additional 55% expect a response within 24 hours. Though many people focus on response time, content is just as important. The same study indicated that lack of a thorough response (45%) will cause on-line customers to view a company negatively when considering future purchases.

                                </br>

                                    An email automatic responder or autoresponder is the second most important marketing tool I have to make money online. The first would be my hosting company. Without these 2 tools my internet marketing business is dead in the water.
                                </br>
                                    In the world of internet marketing, millions of sites are fiercely competing with each other to gain new clients. For any ecommerce site to succeed, it must capture the interest and the trust of its visitors. It is not enough that your site is perfectly designed or has the latest in animation of content.
</br>
                                    You should focus your efforts not only in attracting visitors but also in leading them to make a purchase. There are dozens of marketing strategies you can use to attract more buyers and pump up your sales. One of them is by establishing an excellent and professional reputation for prompt and efficient response.
                                </br>
                                    As more potential customers visit your site, you should expect a flood of inquiries and requests for information. This is an excellent opportunity for you to capture more clients and lead them to buying from your site. Thus, it is important that you carry out an efficient and prompt response to every email you receive. The fastest and most effective way to do this is by utilizing an email automatic responder.
                                </br>
                                    Autoresponder services use a computer program that automatically return a prewritten message to anyone who sends an email to your site. It is widely used for responding to consumer inquiries and visitor comments and suggestions.
                                </br>
                                    Follow up automatic responders are also used by e-zines in responding to people who subscribe or unsubscribe to their online magazines. Companies, who send out their e-newsletter regularly, also use utoresponders.
                                </br>
                                    How can effective autoresponder services help boost your business? The answer lies in its ability to return a prompt response to any e-mail the site receives. By responding rapidly and efficiently, you create a very good impression on your potential customer. Good email autorespondrs help you get important information back to these customers immediately. An effective autoresponder service helps you communicate your message promptly, creating a sense of professionalism and efficiency that your clients will definitely appreciate.
                                </br>
                                    Another very important advantage of email automatic responders is that it saves time with multiple marketing tasks. Certainly, you do not have enough time to personally make and send all correspondence. Autoresponder services allows you to send thank you letters, newsletters, product information, brochures, orders etc. to hundreds of clients almost immediately and simultaneously. Autoresponder services are also indispensable in any email marketing campaign.
                                </br>
                                    Choosing the right autoresponder is very important. What makes the best automatic responder? First, you should pick an autoresponder that is reliable and can give you 24/7 service. You cannot afford to lose a customer because your autoresponder failed to answer his query or request for information. The ability to respond promptly is the first thing you must look for in any automatic responder.
                                </br>
                                    Another key factor you should consider when choosing Autoresponder servcies is flexibility. Good autoresponders allow you to customize unique responses that will have maximum effect on the customer. You should avoid creating an impression that the customer is communicating with a machine instead of a real human being.
                                </br>
                                    An excellent email automatic responder lets you provide the information that is specifically targeted for what the potential customers are looking for. Because any email from potential customers essentially represent the customer’s intent on getting more information about your product, which can ultimately lead to direct sales, all emails are important.

                                <h3><strong>Learn the art of writing Email</strong></h3>
                                <p>Poorly crafted emails will generate additional emails back & forth, which potentially eating up more of your time. Worse, they can drive unnecessary calls to your most costly channel – your phone. And at that point, customers are bound to be angry and frustrated.

                                    Here are some tips for writing email responses that are both thorough and appropriate:
                                </br>
                                    1. Format your response so that it’s easy to read on a screen. Do not write email using very long sentences, which are lengthy horizontally. Each line must be short. Ideally, write 5-6 words in each line only and not more than that.
                                </br>
                                    2. Make sure the subject line is concise and meaningful to the recipient…not just a generic
                                    “Response from Marketing Team” But also be careful that it doesn’t look like spam.
                                    </br>
                                    3. Have one subject per paragraph. Mention this separately by blank lines, so that its easy to read and understand.
                                </br>
                                    4. Be brief. Use as few words as possible to convey your message. More is not better when
                                    it comes to email. An email is not perceived as an electronic letter.
                                    </br>

                                    5. Use simple, declarative sentences. Write for a third or fourth grade audience,
                                    particularly if you’re creating templates that are sent automatically. You do not know the
                                    education level of your sender or the sender’s level of comfort with the English language.
                                    </br>

                                    6. Be sensitive to the tone of the original email. If the sender is upset because of an error on
                                    your part, acknowledge the error. Clearly state what you are doing to correct the situation.
                                </br>
                                    7. Make sure you answer all the questions posed in the original inquiry. A partial answer
                                    
                                    frustrates the sender and results in additional contacts. It also makes the company sending
                                    
                                    the response look inept.
                                </br>
                                    8. Make it clear what actions you will be taking next and when the writer can expect the
                                    
                                    next contact from you.
                                </br>
                                    9. Don’t ask for an order number/case number or any old information which you remember out of your mind only when one is included in the original email…sounds pretty basic, but sometimes people miss very obvious info in email.
                                </br>
                                    10. Don’t just tell the sender to go to your web site. In many cases, they have already been to
                                    
                                    the web site and couldn’t find the answers they were looking for. If you want them to go
                                    
                                    back to the web site, provide a direct link to the exact information the reader needs.</p>
